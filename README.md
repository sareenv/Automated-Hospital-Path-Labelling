## Victoria's Hospital Path Labelling Algorithm. 
The repository contains the designed algorithm implemented on the Vicotia's floor map plan in order with purposal of graph labelling algorithm. The problem was reduced and treated as the one way street problem for which the existing graph algorithms were considered. The program reads the rooms at each floor levels from the text files and purposes an algorithm to automate the labelling of the paths in an undirected graph such that it conforms to the COVID protocol. The algorithm is primarilty based on the <b> Robbins' Theorem </b> and the modified version of the DFS (Depth First Search) algorithm. Following were some of the important tasks which were achieved during the implementation of the algorithms to ensure COVID restrictions are followed properly. 

<ol>
  <li> Represent the hospital map in the form of the graph representation. </li>
  <li> Detection of the connected components. </li>
  <li> Finding the paths from the src node to the dest node. </li>
  <li> Implementation of the modified version of classic DFS (Depth First Algorithm). </li>
</ol>
